# VidiVisus

Data visualisation, using R and Shiny - #uni

VidiVisus is a project carried out by students of Hogeschool Rotterdam. Commisioned by ErasmusMC (Rotterdam), they visualise data regarding [Onchocerciasis][oncho_wiki_en] using R and Shiny.

## Motivation
- Onchocerciasis data is poorly available for in-the-field-workers.
- Predictions and treatments are hard without visualised data.
- Motivated students want to have a bite.
- Fun.
